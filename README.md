My process
Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
CSS positioning (absolute/relative)
Box-shadow effects

What I learned
This project taught me the value of working independently and truly owning my code. While I had CSS knowledge before, it was fragmented — I understood individual concepts but didn't always know how they fit together or when to use them.
Through this challenge, I learned how to:

Use position: absolute and position: relative together to layer elements
Create solid drop shadows using box-shadow with zero blur
Structure my thinking process when approaching a design
Validate my own approaches before implementing them

The biggest takeaway was building confidence in my ability to problem-solve without relying on copy-paste solutions.
Continued development
In future projects, I want to focus on:

Using CSS custom properties (variables) more consistently
Improving my understanding of responsive design patterns
Learning CSS Grid alongside Flexbox
Writing cleaner, more maintainable code from the start

AI Collaboration
I used Claude AI as a learning mentor throughout this project. Rather than providing direct code solutions, Claude helped me:

Structure my fragmented CSS knowledge into cohesive understanding
Learn how different CSS properties work and why they behave certain ways
Debug issues by asking guiding questions rather than giving answers
Validate my thinking and approaches before implementing them

This approach helped me truly understand what I was building rather than just copying solutions. The knowledge I gained feels solid and transferable to future projects.
