## The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

The goal was to recreate the design as closely as possible using only HTML and CSS.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- CSS positioning (absolute / relative)  
- Box-shadow effects  

---

## What I Learned

This project helped me connect my fragmented CSS knowledge into a more structured understanding.

Key learnings:

- Using `position: relative` and `position: absolute` together for layout control  
- Creating strong drop shadows using `box-shadow` with zero blur  
- Breaking down a static design before writing CSS  
- Validating layout logic before implementation  

The biggest takeaway was building confidence in solving layout problems independently.

## Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Using CSS variables more consistently  
- Strengthening responsive design fundamentals  
- Learning and applying CSS Grid  
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable styles  

---

## AI Collaboration

During this project, I used Claude AI as a learning mentor rather than a solution generator.

It helped me:

- Understand CSS behavior more deeply  
- Structure my thinking before writing code  
- Debug issues through guided reasoning  
- Validate implementation decisions  

This approach reinforced conceptual clarity rather than dependency.
